        "     ensures necessary features are consistently _available_ and _freshly computed_ at inference time.\n",
        "3. **Feature and model versioning:** Different teams within an organization are often unable to reuse\n",
        "   features across projects, resulting in duplicate feature creation logic. Models have data dependencies that need\n",
        "   to be versioned, for example when running A/B tests on model versions.\n",
        "   * Feast enables discovery of and collaboration on previously used features and enables versioning of sets of\n",
